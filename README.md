# Wifi-Location-Evaluation
Evaluating Techniques for Wifi Positioning 

This is a Deep Analytics and Visualization class project that I did for the Data Analytics certificate program that I am currently pursuing at the University of Texas - Austin.

In this project, I investigate the feasibility of using "wifi fingerprinting" to determine a person's location in indoor spaces. Wifi fingerprinting uses the signals from multiple wifi hotspots within the building to determine location, analogously to how GPS uses satellite signals. We have been provided with a large database of wifi fingerprints for a multi-building industrial campus with location atributes (building, floor, and location ID) associated with each fingerprint and apply various data modeling and machine learning techniques to identify the most reliable algorithm in predicting users'exact location.
